## Introduction

A clientâ€“server architecture is a distributed application framework that divides tasks between providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.

In the context of MySQL, the MySQL server provides database services (storage, query processing, transaction handling), while clients (applications, users, or other services) connect to it to request data or perform operations.

## Components
### 1. Server Side

- **MySQL Server (mysqld):** The main database server process that manages databases, handles SQL queries, enforces security, and ensures concurrency.

- **Database (Schema):** Logical collections of tables, views, indexes, and stored procedures.

### 2. Client Side

- **Applications:** Web apps, desktop apps, scripts, or command-line clients that query the database.

- **MySQL Client Utilities:** Such as mysql CLI, GUI tools (MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin), or custom applications via libraries (JDBC, ODBC, Python connectors).

## How Clientâ€“Server Works in MySQL

1. **Client Connection:** A client (user or application) sends a connection request to the MySQL server using IP address/hostname, port 3306 (default), username, and password.
  
    Example: `mysql -h 192.168.1.10 -u dbuser -p`

2. **Authentication:** The MySQL server validates credentials against its user privilege system.

3. **Request Processing:** 

    - The client sends SQL queries (e.g., SELECT * FROM users;).

    - The server parses, optimizes, and executes the query.

4. **Response:** The server returns the result set or error messages to the client.

5. **Disconnection:** The session ends when the client disconnects, releasing server resources.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

### Set Up the MySQL Server

- **In Mysql server session, run the cmd below and Configure root password and basic security.:**
    ```bash
    # Update system
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

    # Install MySQL server
    sudo apt install mysql-server -y

    # Secure the installation
    sudo mysql_secure_installation
    ```

    ![Server Image](/images/mysqlserve1.png)

- **Configure MySQL for Remote Access (Server-Side):** By default, MySQL only listens on localhost (127.0.0.1).

    1. Edit the config file:
        ```bash
        sudo nano /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
        ```
        ![Server Image](/images/mysqlserve2.png)
    2. Look for:
        ```ini
        bind-address = 127.0.0.1
        ```
        ![Server Image](/images/mysqlserve3a.png)
    3. ðŸ‘‰ Change it to allow external clients:
        ```ini
        bind-address = 0.0.0.0
        ```
        ![Server Image](/images/mysqlserve3b.png)
    4. Save and close 

- **Restart MySQL:**
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart mysql
    ```
    ![Server Image](/images/mysqlserve4.png)

- **Create a Database & User**

    1. **Login as root**
        ```bash
        sudo mysql -u root -p
        ```
        ![Server Image](/images/mysqlserve5.png)
    
    2. **Create database & a user with remote access, Grant permissions and Apply changes.**

        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE clientserver_db;
        CREATE USER 'client_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Strong.Password123';
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON clientserver_db.* TO 'client_user'@'%';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        exit;
        ```
        ![Server Image](/images/mysqlserversetup.png)
    3. Verify Databases
        ```sql
        SHOW databases;
        ```

- **Create a Table and insert sample data in the Database created `clientserver_db`**

    - âœ… Step 1: Switch to your database
        ```sql
        USE clientserver_db;
        ``` 
    - âœ… Step 2: Create a table, Hereâ€™s an employees table:
        ```sql
        CREATE TABLE employees (
            id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
            first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
            email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            department VARCHAR(50),
            salary DECIMAL(10,2)
        );
        ```
    - âœ… Step 3: Insert 10 sample rows:
        ```sql
        INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, department, salary) VALUES
        ('John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com', 'IT', 60000.00),
        ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', 'HR', 50000.00),
        ('Michael', 'Brown', 'michael.brown@example.com', 'Finance', 70000.00),
        ('Emily', 'Johnson', 'emily.johnson@example.com', 'Marketing', 55000.00),
        ('Daniel', 'Williams', 'daniel.williams@example.com', 'Operations', 65000.00),
        ('Sarah', 'Davis', 'sarah.davis@example.com', 'IT', 62000.00),
        ('David', 'Miller', 'david.miller@example.com', 'Finance', 72000.00),
        ('Sophia', 'Wilson', 'sophia.wilson@example.com', 'HR', 48000.00),
        ('James', 'Taylor', 'james.taylor@example.com', 'IT', 64000.00),
        ('Olivia', 'Anderson', 'olivia.anderson@example.com', 'Marketing', 56000.00);
        ```
        ![Server Image](/images/table.png)
    - âœ… Step 4: Verify data
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM employees;
        ```
        ![Server Image](/images/table0.png)

### Setup and Connect From the Client

- **From the client machine `Mysql Client`, install MySQL client:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt install mysql-client -y
    ```
    ![Server Image](/images/mysqlclient1.png)

- **Connect to the Mysql Server:**
    ```bash
    mysql -h <SERVER_IP> -u client_user -p
    ```
    ![Server Image](/images/connected.png)    
You should now reach the MySQL server remotely.

- **Test for Connectivity using:**
    - **Ping:**
    ```bash
    ping <mysql server private IP>  
    ```
    ![Server Image](/images/network1.png) 
    - **Telnet:**
    ```bash
    telnet <mysql server private IP> 3306  
    ```
    ![Server Image](/images/network2.png)  

- **Querry for the Database we created earlier on Mysql Server from this Client side:**

    ```sql
    USE clientserver_db;
    SELECT * FROM employees;
    ```
    ![Server Image](/images/table2.png)

_We have successfuly completed our deployment as our client can make requests from our server_
